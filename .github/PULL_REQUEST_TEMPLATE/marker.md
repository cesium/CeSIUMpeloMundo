When adding a new marker, you must do 2 things:
- Add an image to show alongside the marker. This image must be stored under `public/photos`, in a folder named after your GitHub username
- Edit the `places.ts` file under `data`, adding an entry with the following shape:
```ts
{
    author: '...', // First and Last name of the people involved, or a list whose elements match that definition
    username: '...', // username or list of usernames of the people involved
    type: ..., // type of the marker, see below
    city: '...', // the city where the image was taken
    country: '...', // the country where the image was taken
    coordinates: [..., ...], // The coordinates of the marker (ideally, but not necessarily, exact)
    date: '...', // The date when the image was taken, in the formate YYYY-MM-DD
    streetview?: '...', // Optional link to Google Map Street View
    photo: '...' // The actual image taken, stored under "public/photos"
}
```

Available pin types are:
- Sticker
- Merch
- Picture
- Missing
  
> Note: Missing should be used when updating a marker
