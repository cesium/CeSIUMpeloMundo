## üóÉÔ∏è Adding your pins

**1.** Move to the `public/photos` directory

**2.** Create a folder and name it your GitHub username(s). You'll save your pictures here

**3.** Move to the `data` directory and open the `places.ts` file on your favorite editor

**4.** Add a new object to the array containing:

- `author` - your first and last name(s)
- `username` - your GitHub username(s)
- `type` - pin type (**`EPinType.<pin-type>`**)
- `city` & `country` - city and country where the image was taken
- `coordinates` - you can use [**this website**](https://www.gps-coordinates.net/my-location)
- `date` - date of when the image was taken (year-month-day format)
- `photo` - path to your image file

**Understanding Pin Types:**

- `EPinType.Sticker` - You left a CeSIUM sticker somewhere
- `EPinType.Picture` - Anything CeSIUM related that isn't a sticker
- `EPinType.Missing` - You revisited a pin and the sticker is now missing

**Check out this example:**

```typescript
{
  author: 'Filipe Fel√≠cio',
  username: 'feliciofilipe',
  type: EPinType.Picture,
  city: 'Barcelona',
  country: 'Spain',
  coordinates: [41.39437640777792, 2.1750122226070197],
  date: '2022-03-21',
  photo: '/photos/feliciofilipe/barcelona.jpg'
}
```

**Multiple authors? Check this one:**

```typescript
{
  author: ['Filipe Fel√≠cio', 'Matilde Bravo', 'Mariana Rodrigues'],
  username: ['feliciofilipe', 'matildeopbravo', 'marianarodrigues'],
